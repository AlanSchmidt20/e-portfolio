        <p>Hey! My name is Alan Schmidt, I played tennis all my life while I was getting my knowledge in the IT sector. 
           These years I have worked as a team and tennis has given me skills such as leadership and teamwork that I feel can be useful for the programming branch. 
           Now I seek to focus on what I have studied during these last years since it is something that excites me and I love.</p>
